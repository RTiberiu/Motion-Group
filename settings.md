# Explanations for `settings.json`

In `hoverElements`, group items to belong to one object instead.
    - Structure:
        "groupName": ["objectName1", "objectName2"]
    - Important note: The first object name should represent the biggest canvas, as this object's height and width will be used to calculate where the text will spawn.
